The functionalities that I added in the project:
- Heart model that when saving a sheep moves up, rotates around, scales down and disappears after a short time.
  
- Different sound effects when the sheep is hit by a hay, when a sheep is dropped and when a hay is shot.
  
- Activate a Game Over Window.
  
- Counter of sheep saved and sheep dropped. When 3 sheep are dropped, the game ends.
  
- Edit title scene:
  -  Start button: Initiates game.
  -  Quit button: Quits game.
  -  When the mouse hovers over each button, the buttons are highlighted.
    
- Allow the user to modify the color of the Hay Machine (blue, yellow, red)
